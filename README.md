# interpego

Following along with [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

Extra features implemented in the interpreter, relative to what is implemented in the book:

- `map`, `reduce` builtins
- for loops

Still to-implement in the compiler:

- function literals
- function calls/closures
- for loops
- builtins

## TODO
